/*Question: The output in geekforgeeks is 27 but why do codeblocks have different output?
And also how is the right solution as 27 .Please help .


Answer: CODEBLOCKS IS ALSO PROVIDING THE SAME OUTPUT!

		The for loop adds all the elements of the array,and the compiler considers the out-of-boundry elements(array[7] is not a member of the array) value to be zero.
		Thereby provides the result as 27(0+2+4+6+7+5+3).
