In int main() the size of array is 60 as :
{ 15 elements *4byte=60.}

But when we pass array as a function of pointer it copies the address of the first element of array n pass it as a pointer. By this address we can access the rest of the elements.

So in the function when array is passed it is now a pointer and not an array.

As the size of pointer is the same as the size of the data type it points to, The size of array is also 8 byte in 64-bit compiler.

But in 32-bit itâ€™s size will be 4 byte.
